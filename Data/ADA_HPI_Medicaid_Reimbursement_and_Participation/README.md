# American Dental Association Health Policy Institute Medicaid Reimbursement & Participation report, 2016

This report from the ADA HPI delineates state-level dentist participation in Medicaid and the percent of private insurance fees that Medicaid typically covers.

## Examples of questions this dataset could help answer

* Which state has the highest participation of dentists in Medicaid?
* What percent of Indiana adults participate in Medicaid?
* Which states have the lowest typical reimbursement of Medicaid dental services compared to private insurance?

## Utility

This dataset helps states understand two of the largest factors commonly discussed as indicating the health of their Medicaid programs. 

## Orientation & Stewardship  

The report was produced by the Health Policy Institute and is available on their [website](https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Science%20and%20Research/HPI/Files/HPIgraphic_0417_1.pdf?la=en).

## Original Data Structure

The pdf report was presented data in four columns: 

* Participation in Medicaid for *dentists* and *physicians*. 
* Reimbursement as a percent of private for *dentists* and *physicians*. 

## Converted Data Structure

For the National Oral Health Data Portal project only the dentist data were kept. There were manually copied from the PDF into a CSV titled **Medicaid_FFS_reimbursement_and_participation_2016** located in [this Github repository folder](https://github.com/PositiveSumData/NationalOralHealthDataPortal/upload/master/Data/ADA_HPI_Medicaid_Reimbursement_and_Participation).

## Issues & decisions

None to report.

## Code

No code was needed as the amount of data was small and it could be more easily copied from the pdf manually.

## Tableau Presentation

The presentation is located on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/association.of.state.territorial.dental.directors#!/vizhome/ADAHPIMedicaidparticipationreimbursement/Orientation).

Two dashboards are presented:

* **State Bar Graphs**. Plots side-by-side bar graphs showing performance on both measures for all states at once.
* **State Dot Plots**. Plots the two measures against each other on one dot plot, with each state as a dot.

## Status & Next Steps

The Tableau viz has been published. Feedback is appreciated.
