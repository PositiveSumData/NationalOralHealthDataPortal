# Welcome

Welcome to the National Oral Health Data Portal GitHub repository, a project of the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors with funding from Delta Dental of Michigan and GlaxoSmithKline. Our aim is to build the country's first ever national oral health data portal, consolidating our important oral health data sources in one place to make it easy for people from across the oral health care system can quickly find and understand the information they need to help improve oral health. 

This project is currently in a beta-testing phase. We encourage you to interact with this repository, check out our Tableau visualizations, and to let us know what you think. Ideally, you'd help us out by joining us in the **Discussions** tab â€” report a bug, suggest an alternative way of visualizing information, suggest new data sources, or give general feedback. If you'd like to see what tasks are currently on our plate, see the **Projects** tab. If you'd rather contact us directly, please email OMJOHN@umich.edu.

This repository is arranged as a mirror of the National Oral Health Data Portal website: there is a folder containing "Data" and a folder containing "Surveillance and Tools". Click on each folder to see subfolders. Each folder has a "README" file that explains the files it contains and provides documentation on the data project. Users can download data tables directly, learn where the data came from, download R code to replicate our work, and see what they should watch out for in interpreting the information.
