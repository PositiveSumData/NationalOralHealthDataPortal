# Healthy People 2030

A dashboard for tracking status on the national oral health objectives set in 2020 to achieve by 2030.

## Examples of questions this dataset could help answer

* How many oral health objectives for set for HP 2030?
* What is the 2030 target set for proportion of adults with active or untreated tooth decay.
* How many percentage points are needed to achieve the OH-07 target from baseline?

## Utility

This dashboard helps monitor status of all the HP2030 oral health objectives in one place.

## Data Stewardship  

Healthy People is a national health target-setting and progress monitoring project lead by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. At the close of each decade, national stakeholders determine the country's health priorities and what meaningful improvements could be made by the end of the following decade. Healthy People 2030 launched in 2020 with 15 official measures and one developmental (OH-D01) measure:

| Objective Number | Objective Description |
| ------ | ----- |
| OH‑03 | Reduce the proportion of adults with active or untreated tooth decay |
| OH‑07 | Increase the proportion of oral and pharyngeal cancers detected at the earliest stage |
| OH‑08 | Increase the proportion of children, adolescents, and adults who use the oral health care system |
| OH‑01 | Reduce the proportion of children and adolescents with lifetime tooth decay experience in their primary or permanent teeth |
| OH‑02 | Reduce the proportion of children and adolescents with active and currently untreated tooth decay in their primary or permanent teeth |
| AHS‑02 | Increase the proportion of persons with dental insurance |
| AHS‑05 | Reduce the proportion of persons who are unable to obtain or delayed in obtaining necessary dental care |
| OH‑11 | Increase the proportion of persons served by community systems with optimally fluoridated water systems |
| NWS‑10 | Reduce the consumption of calories from added sugars by persons aged 2 years and over |
| OH‑04 | Reduce the proportion of older adults with untreated root surface decay |
| OH‑05 | Reduce the proportion of adults aged 45 years and over who have lost all of their natural teeth |
| OH‑06 | Reduce the proportion of adults aged 45 years and over with moderate and severe periodontitis |
| OH‑09 | Increase the proportion of low income youth who have a preventive dental visit |
| OH‑10 | Increase the proportion of children and adolescents who have received dental sealants on 1 or more of their primary or permanent molar teeth |
| OH‑D01 | Increase the number of states and the District of Columbia that have an oral and craniofacial health surveillance system |

Objectives were chosen that had reliable national datasets that could monitor achievement. State targets were not set, and most of the datasets used in HP 2030 do not have state breakouts. For example, the National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) doesn't have a large enough sample size to permit state-level reporting.

## Original Data Structures

The HP2030 baselines have been established, and since it launched so recently that's currently all the data the project has so far. Data were obtained by manually copying it from the HP2030 [oral conditions](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/oral-conditions) webpage. 

## Converted Data Structure

The file **HP2030_objectives.csv** was created to include a description of each objective, the baselines, and the target. It is available in this Github repository folder.

## Issues & decisions

No issues -- there's not much to do with this dataset yet.

## Code

No code was needed to modify or calculate since there is so little to work with yet. 

## Tableau Presentation

The presentation is located on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/association.of.state.territorial.dental.directors#!/vizhome/HealthyPeople2030/Orientation).

A single dashboard has been created presenting the targets and baseline for each objective.

## Status & Next Steps

While the baseline dashboard is up, the website will need to be continuously monitored for progress updates.
