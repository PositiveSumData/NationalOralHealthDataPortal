# Healthy People 2020

A dashboard for tracking status on the national oral health objectives set in 2010 to achieve by 2020.

## Examples of questions this dataset could help answer

* Were there any national oral health targets that weren't achieved by 2020? 
* What was the national target set for percent of adults aged 65-74 with edentulism?
* What is the latest status on OH 6 - oral and pharyngeal cancer detected at the earliest stage?

## Utility

This dashboard helps monitor status of all the HP2020 oral health objectives in one place.

## Data Stewardship  

Healthy People is a national health target-setting and progress monitoring project lead by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. At the close of each decade, national stakeholders determine the country's health priorities and what meaningful improvements could be made by the end of the following decade. Healthy People 2020 launched in 2010 with the following 33 oral health objectives: 

| objective # | objective description |
| ----------- | --------------------- |

Objectives were chosen that had reliable national datasets that could monitor achievement. State targets were not set, and most of the datasets used in HP 2020 do not have state breakouts. For example, the National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) doesn't have a large enough sample size to permit state-level reporting.

## Original Data Structures

HP 2020 oral health objectives, baselines, progress, and targets are shown on the HP 2020 website, which allows a user to [query](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data-search/) for the oral health topic. Once the oral health topic is suggested, a list of all the objectives is shown. For each objective, users can "download all data for this HP2020 objective" by clicking on a button and receiving a spreadsheet. 

While we've reached the end of 2020, we can't say yet if any of the objectives are met because final reporting isn't yet available. Most of the datasets require pooling years together and presenting confidence intervals, so it may be a few years before datasets like NHANES are able to tell us if targets have been met.

## Converted Data Structure

Three files were generated based on data pulled from the HP2020 website:

* **HP2020_objectives.csv**. Each row is a unique objective. Columns describe details about each objective, the baseline, and the target. An abbreviated objective name column was created to make it easier to present in the Tableau dashboards.

* **HP2020_data.csv**. Each row is a unique objective-year. For every year of data on a given objective, there is a separate row; objectives with multiple progress years tracked on the HP2020 website will appear on many rows in this file. 

* **HP2020_CI.csv**. A file of strictly the 95% confidence intervals for each estimate in the HP2020_data file, un-pivoted such that each row is a unique objective-year-CI_level. This formatting allows Tableau to draw confidence interval bars on charts.

## Issues & decisions

It's too soon yet to determine if any objectives are officially met, but the Tableau dashboards are set up to show status (met/not met/possibly met) based on the latest data available. An objective was considered 'not met' if the estimate has not surpassed the target boundary. An objective was considered 'possibly met' if the estimate crossed the target boundary but the 95% confidence interval did not. An objective was considered met if both the estimate and the 95% confidence interval crossed the target boundary.

Some of the objectives do have more current progress information available than shown on the HP2020 website, but for now Positive Sum has decided not to supplement official HP2020 monitoring with unofficial progress data. If the community recommends doing this it could be a good next step, or we could wait until more official updates are made on the HP2020 website.

## Code

The file **CI_code.R**, contained in this Github repository folder, helps produce the HP2020_CI.csv file based on HP2020_data.csv as input.

## Tableau Presentation

The presentation is located on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/association.of.state.territorial.dental.directors#!/vizhome/HealthyPeople2020/Orientation).

Two dashboards are presented:

* **Objectives Status**. Shows the target, baseline, status, and 'status as of' date for each objective.

* **Objective Trends**. Allows a user to select an objective and see any progress since baseline.

## Status & Next Steps

* Should we manually add updated progress data or wait for official updates from HP2020?
